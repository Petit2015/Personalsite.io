	Hello Everyone! My name is Frandeline Petit. I am a registered nurse for almost three years now. Currently I have an interest in the computer science and plan on pursuing it. Although I know nothing about the field, I am extremely excited about submerging myself into it. <Br>  I know it won't be easy to learn but I know I am up for the challenge. I can't wait to see what I am capable of creating.

	<h2>Favorite Music</h2>

	<strong>Natasha Bedingfield " Unwritten"</strong><br><br>
	This song has been my favorite since I was a child. The way I interpret this song is that there is so much to life and that your "story" is never over.Even if things seem rough now, things can change. This song has always seem to help me put things into perspective.  <br><br><br>
